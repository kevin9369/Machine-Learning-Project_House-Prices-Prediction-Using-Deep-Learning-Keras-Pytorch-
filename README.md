# Machine Learning Project_House Prices Prediction Using Deep Learning (Keras & Pytorch) and XGBoost
1. Built an MLP regressor and used evaluation index (MSE/MAE/MAPE) to predict median house value
2. Built a MLP model that includes 4 layers and nonlinear activation (Sigmoid)
3. Based on the result, we can find that the MSE/ MAE/ MAPE of the MLP model are 0.019, 0.098, and 0.28. The MSE/ MAE/ MAPE of XGBoost are 22928, 32029, and 0.178. Therefore, the method of MLP model is better than  the method of XGBoost.
4. About accurency, the MLP model is 0.042. The XGBoost is 33383. Therefore, the accurncy of MLP model is also better than the accurncy of XGBoost.
